There's a missing critical point at the very beginning: the specification of the configuration file. This should be the very beginning of the conception phase, addressing how the configuration file will be structured and how new commands will be integrated. For example, how will a "git" command be interpreted - is it built into the binary, a plugin, or another configuration? The tool aims to ensure developers won't face errors due to missing dependencies - the tool should automatically install what's absent. This architectural decision needs to be discussed first to decide what's best before proceeding with the roadmap implementation.
